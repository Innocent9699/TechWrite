Markdown syntax is straightforward and easy to learn. Here is a basic syntax guide:

Headers: Use hashtags (#) to create headers.
# Header 1

### Header 3
Paragraphs: Just write your text. To start a new paragraph, leave a blank line.

Unordered: * Item 1
Ordered: 1. Item 1
Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (````) before and after the code block and specify the language for syntax highlighting (optional).
print("Hello, World!")
Bold and Italic: Use double asterisks (**) for bold and single asterisks (*) for italic.
Bold Text
Italic Text
Links: Wrap the link text in brackets [ ] and the URL in parentheses ().
